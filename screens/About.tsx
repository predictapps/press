        Limitations
      </Heading>
      <Li>
        PRESS can aid prognostication of dysphagia recovery but its clinical
        usefulness to influence medical decisions has not been tested.

        Prediction
      </Heading>
      <Li>
        PRESS provides time-dependent predictions for recovery of impaired oral
        intake according to the total PRESS value. 95% confidence intervals (CI)
        are also displayed.
      </Li>
      <Li>
        Guidelines recommend enteral tube feeding if impaired oral intake
        persists for ≥ 7 days after stroke. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy
        (PEG) should be preferred if impaired oral intake persists for ≥ 30 days
        after stroke.

        Performance
      </Heading>
      <Li>
        PRESS was developed in 153 stroke survivors in Switzerland and
        prospectively validated in 126 separate subjects.
      </Li>
      <Li>
        Discrimination in validation cohort: c statistic of 0.84 for predicting
        recovery of oral intake on day 7 and 0.77 on day 30; c statistic of 0.94
        for predicting return to prestroke diet on day 7 and 0.71 on day 30.
      </Li>
      <Li>
        Calibration in validation cohort: high agreement between predicted and
        observed outcomes.
