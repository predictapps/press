          Risk of aspiration is evaluated at the initial swallowing evaluation
          using the
          <B>Any 2 Scale</B> (Daniels et al. 1997). One point is given for each
          of the six items.

          <B>Dysphonia</B> A voice disturbance in the parameters of vocal
          quality, pitch or intensity.
        </Li>
        <Li>
          <B>Dysarthria</B> A speech disorder resulting from disturbances in
          muscular control affecting the areas of respiration, articulation,
          phonation, resonance, or prosody.
        </Li>
        <Li>
          <B>Abnormal gag reflex</B> Either absent or weakend velar or
          pharyngeal wall contraction, unilaterally or bilaterally, in response
          to tactile stimulation of the posterior pharyngeal wall.
        </Li>

          <B>Abnormal volitional cough</B> A weak response, verbalized response,
          or no response on given the command to cough.

        <Li>
          <B>Cough after swallow</B> Cough immediate or within 1 minute of
          ingestion of calibrated volumes of water (5, 10, and 20ml presented in
          duplicate).
        </Li>

          <B>Voice change after swallow</B> Alteration in vocal quality
          following ingestion of calibrated volumes of water.

        <P>
          If a subjects cannot be evaluated due to severe impairment (i.e.
          reduced alertness, severe aphasia), a score of 6 points is given.
